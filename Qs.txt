Questions that I have:

What is a div in html?

Are there downsides to having a video in the
background of a website? Does it take longer to load?

What is h2, h3, and p in html?

html is the formatting and placement
CSS is the style 
JavaScript is the animation and interaction.

"controls" is a flag

Things I wanna add:
- music. 
- a pause button that darkens the background. similar to: https://codepen.io/dudleystorey/pen/BaPeZP
- a button that also pauses the background. 
- a transparent box for the text to be on. 
- make the video crop with scaling of the window

JavaScript can also be included inside of HTML code.
